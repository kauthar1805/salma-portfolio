 Tools i Used
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- Git & GitHub
- Github Pages (for deployment)

 Key Features i Implemented
- Dynamic greeting based on time of day using JavaScript
- Form validation with regular expressions (email, name)
- Light/Dark theme toggle
- Embedded YouTube video at the bottom of the page
- Interactive project section (show/hide project descriptions)
- DOM manipulation and event handling

 Challenges Faced and Solutions
- Scroll not working**: Solved by correcting unclosed `<div>` tags and misused `<style>` placement.
- Video position issue**: Ensured video was placed after all main content and styled with flexbox to stay centered.
- Form success message**: Used JavaScript to prevent default form submission and show a "Thank you" message without reloading the page.
